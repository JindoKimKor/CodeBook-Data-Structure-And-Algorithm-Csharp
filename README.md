# CodeBook-Data-Structure-And-Algorithm-Csharp

This repository contains my solutions and approaches for practicing data structures and algorithms using C#, as well as for solving problems on LeetCode.

## Purpose
- To practice various data structures and algorithms using C#.
- To solve problems on LeetCode and document both my solutions and the problem codes for testing my solutions.
- To utilize this repository as a personal codebook for future reference.

## Structure
- Folders are organized based on the difficulty levels of LeetCode problems, and each problem's name is used for C# Project Name/Folder Name. The data structures and algorithms used are documented in the Update Summary.

## Contact
- For any questions or suggestions, please contact jindokim.kor@gmail.com.
